# savio-training-intro-fall-2019

Materials for Savio introductory training for September 19, 2019.

The main document is `intro.html` (or `intro_slides.html` if you prefer a version that appears in slide-show format rather than as one long HTML page).

To directly view the HTML, please [click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-intro-fall-2019/blob/master/intro_slides.html).

If you're not familiar with Git or Github you can download the materials as a [zip file](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-intro-fall-2019/archive/master.zip)
